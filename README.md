 Design Choices

- JWT Auth: Lightweight and stateless authentication.
- Password Security: Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storing.
- Embedded Reviews: Reviews live inside the book document to simplify reads and improve performance.
- Pagination: Added to keep endpoints performant with growing data.
- Search: Built with case-insensitive regex for flexibility.
- Error Handling: Centralized error middleware for clean, consistent error responses.
